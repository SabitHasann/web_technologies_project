It's a Clinic Management System using PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. Course: Web Technologies. Semester: 2023-2024, Fall.

Clinic Management System (CMS) is a project that aims to improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare services in clinics. This project will develop a web-based application that can handle patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical reports, administrative tasks, prescription management, and patient records management. The project is motivated by the need to reduce manual work, errors, and delays in the clinic operations and to enhance patient satisfaction and trust.

Here, I'm working on the 'Doctor User' part only.

The “Doctor” has the following features:
• Check list of appointments of current day
• Write and Print prescriptions
• Check previous prescriptions of any patient
• Add, Remove & Update (CRUD operation) of Medicine
• Search and read lab reports
• Update profile
